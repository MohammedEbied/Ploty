        The 'colorbar' property is an instance of ColorBar
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.ColorBar
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the ColorBar constructor
    
            Supported dict properties:
                
                bgcolor
                    Sets the color of padded area.
                bordercolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                borderwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing
                    this color bar.
                dtick
                    Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis.
                    Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or
                    special strings available to "log" and "date"
                    axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks
                    are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick
                    number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,
                    10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick
                    marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To
                    set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...
                    set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"
                    has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`
                    is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
                    spaced in value (but not position). For example
                    `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
                    at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10
                    plus small digits between, use "D1" (all
                    digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is
                    ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`
                    is "date", then you must convert the time to
                    milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
                    between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
                    86400000.0. "date" also has special values
                    "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of
                    months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set
                    ticks on the 15th of every third month, set
                    `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To
                    set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                len
                    Sets the length of the color bar This measure
                    excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the
                    color bar length is this length minus the
                    padding on both ends.
                lenmode
                    Determines whether this color bar's length
                    (i.e. the measure in the color variation
                    direction) is set in units of plot "fraction"
                    or in *pixels. Use `len` to set the value.
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                outlinecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                outlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                    drawn.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                thickness
                    Sets the thickness of the color bar This
                    measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks
                    and labels.
                thicknessmode
                    Determines whether this color bar's thickness
                    (i.e. the measure in the constant color
                    direction) is set in units of plot "fraction"
                    or in "pixels". Use `thickness` to set the
                    value.
                tick0
                    Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                    axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                    "log", then you must take the log of your
                    starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                    100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                    `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                    the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                    string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                    "category", it should be a number, using the
                    scale where each category is assigned a serial
                    number from zero in the order it appears.
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickcolor
                    Sets the tick color.
                tickfont
                    Sets the color bar's tick label font
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h

                    add one item to d3's date formatter: "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                    "09~15~23.46"

                    Sets the tick length (in px).
                tickmode
                    Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                    the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                    "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                    determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                    tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                    value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                    "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                    `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                    ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                    provided).
                tickprefix
                    Sets a tick label prefix.
                ticks
                    Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                    "", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                    "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                    outside (inside) the axis lines.
                ticksuffix
                    Sets a tick label suffix.
                ticktext
                    Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                    via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                    `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                    `tickvals`.
                ticktextsrc
                    Sets the source reference on plot.ly for
                    ticktext .

                    Sets the tick width (in px).
                title
                    Sets the title of the color bar.
                titlefont

                titleside
                    Determines the location of the colorbar title
                    with respect to the color bar.
                x
                    Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot
                    fraction).
                xanchor
                    Sets this color bar's horizontal position
                    anchor. This anchor binds the `x` position to
                    the "left", "center" or "right" of the color
                    bar.
                xpad
                    Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x
                    direction.
                y
                    Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot
                    fraction).
                yanchor
                    Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor
                    This anchor binds the `y` position to the

                coloring
                    Determines the coloring method showing the
                    contour values. If "fill", coloring is done
                    evenly between each contour level If "heatmap",
                    a heatmap gradient coloring is applied between
                    each contour level. If "lines", coloring is
                    done on the contour lines. If "none", no
                    coloring is applied on this trace.
                end
                    Sets the end contour level value. Must be more
                    than `contours.start`
                labelfont
                    Sets the font used for labeling the contour
                    levels. The default color comes from the lines,
                    if shown. The default family and size come from
                    `layout.font`.
                labelformat
                    Sets the contour label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-language which is very similar
                    to Python, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format

                operation
                    Sets the constraint operation. "=" keeps
                    regions equal to `value` "<" and "<=" keep
                    regions less than `value` ">" and ">=" keep

                    outside `value[0]` to value[1]` Open vs. closed
                    intervals make no difference to constraint
                    display, but all versions are allowed for
                    consistency with filter transforms.
                showlabels
                    Determines whether to label the contour lines
                    with their values.
                showlines
                    Determines whether or not the contour lines are
                    drawn. Has an effect only if
                    `contours.coloring` is set to "fill".
                size
                    Sets the step between each contour level. Must
                    be positive.
                start
                    Sets the starting contour level value. Must be
                    less than `contours.end`
                type
                    If `levels`, the data is represented as a
                    contour plot with multiple levels displayed. If
                    `constraint`, the data is represented as
                    constraints with the invalid region shaded as
                    specified by the `operation` and `value`
                    parameters.
                value
                    Sets the value or values of the constraint
                    boundary. When `operation` is set to one of the
                    comparison values (=,<,>=,>,<=) "value" is
                    expected to be a number. When `operation` is
                    set to one of the interval values
                    ([],(),[),(],][,)(,](,)[) "value" is expected

        autobinx
            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
            determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
            However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
            update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
            from the trace.
        autobiny
            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
            determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
            However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
            update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
            from the trace.
        autocolorscale
            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
            `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
        autocontour
            Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
            are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of
            contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If False, set
            the contour level attributes in `contours`.
        colorbar
            plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.ColorBar instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
            required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1,
            'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the
            colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
            string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
            d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

        contours
            plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.Contours instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
        histfunc
            Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
            trace. If "count", the histogram values are computed by
            counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
            "sum", "avg", "min", "max", the histogram values are
            computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
            maximum of the values lying inside each bin
            respectively.
        histnorm
            Specifies the type of normalization used for this
            histogram trace. If "", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
            number of data points lying inside the bins). If
            "percent" / "probability", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
            with respect to the total number of sample points
            (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
            "density", the span of each bar corresponds to the
            number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
            the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
            the total number of sample points). If *probability
            density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
            probability that an event will fall into the
            corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
            equals 1).
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed

            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale

            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
            required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)', [1,

            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
            this trace.
        stream
            plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.Stream instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        uid

        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xbins
            plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.XBins instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
        y
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ybins
            plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.YBins instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
        z
            Sets the aggregation data.
        zauto
            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
            with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
            bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
            when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
        zhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting
            mini-languages which are very similar to those in
            Python. See: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/maste
            r/README.md#locale_format
        zmax
            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
            be set as well.
        zmin
            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
            be set as well.
        zsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
